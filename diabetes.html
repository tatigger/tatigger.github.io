<h2>Diabetes</h2>
<p>
I am a Do-It-Yourself kind of girl.  I discovered long ago that the usual rules don't seem to apply to my set of circumstances.  Not in Diabetes, not in life.  Over the years and through experiment and experience, each journey in diabetes care yields lessons that the individual needs to note and then build upon.  These lessons seldom are set in stone.  Things change.  Technology advances, studies yield results, and new relationships with providers and others provide ways to improve our individual plans.
</p>
<p>
The Nightscout and DIYPS communities provided guidance and motivation that helped me journey down a path of better care.  There are technology components that helped a lot, but also the collected ideas and experience of these large communities provided small, non-technological ways to make big impacts on my own care.  
</P>
<p>
My rig is shown above.  I have a Dexcom G4 continuous blood glucose meter, a Medtronic 522 insulin pump, a Pebble Time watch, and a tiny Edison computer with an Explorer Board to link all of them together.  Thing 1, my Edison/Explorer Board, makes decisions every 5 minutes based on the data it pulls together from my pump, my Dexcom, and my entries into my Nightscout webpage (mostly carbohydrate data).  If I could think about diabetes, my last 12 hours, my next 3 hours, and lots of math, these decisions are the best decisions I could make for myself.  No one can devote that kind of attention to only one facet of their lives, and so I rely on Thing1 to do it for me.  I have listed a number of links to 
different websites where interested people can learn more about the process from other people like us.
