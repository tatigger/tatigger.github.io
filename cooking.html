<h2>Cooking</h2>
<p>
In general I eat relatively low-carb. It makes my life easier. Salads are a nearly daily part of the strategy. Pictured above is some lettuce that I harvested from my garden. Recipes can be hard to evaluate, although there are many available online and in magazines and books. Recipes and packaged foods that are "low-carb" are often higher in fat. Be selective about which fats and amounts that you use. Here I include some recipes that I enjoy.

<p> I made several small adaptations to the original recipe found on The Detoxinista website (recipe linked with the clickable title above).  Shredded zucchini needs to have as much moisture as possible squeezed out prior to use.  I twist a cup at a time in a thin kitchen towel (like the flour sack type of towel) and squeeze like crazy.  I bake at high altitude, but made no adjustments for the altitude.  I freeze individual slices or muffins on a parchment-lined sheet, then wrap in each serving in foil and store in a labeled zip-lock bag.  Otherwise my 12 muffins would last 5 minutes.  Maybe not even that long.
Don't forget to add the carbs and fat to the total for the chocolate chips you use.
