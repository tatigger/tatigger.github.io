<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
You are probably here because diabetes is part of your life (or the life of someone you care about), but you don't want it to be your whole life.  There are many ways to enjoy life and still live well with diabetes.  You will find some of the ways that I try to do that here.  
</p>
<p>
I have lived with diabetes since 1982.  My diagnosis was pretty complicated and not typical of most Type 1 diagnoses.  I have had times in life when financial choices were very limited, and times when things were not as hard.  I have dealt with complications like peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy.  Insulin has been dosed via syringe, pen and insulin pump. Blood sugars have been tested with many of the options that have been available over the years.  Through it all, I have struggled to find ways to be a person first, and a person with diabetes second.  Ok, I may have moved diabetes lower down in the list than "second" at times.  In short, I am just like you.
