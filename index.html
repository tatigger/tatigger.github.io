	<p>Hello! I have lined two projects that I have built in the navigation above. <a href="HiddenUtility/indexHU.html">HiddenUtility</a> is a mock e-commerce site featuring items that I have made.  The form isn't linked to anything, it is for demonstration purposes only. The email is working. Please direct comments or inquiries to that email. Thanks!</p>
	<p><a href="RailAround/indexRA.html">Rail Around</a> is my project designed to help people locate businesses and services within short walking distance of Valley Metro light rail stops. This project is under construction. The email is working - please contact me with your comments or suggestions!</p>
